  sentences:
  - My my, so you managed to slay that abomination did you now?
  - No one has slain a demon before.
  - Could you be the one we've been waiting for...?
  - Oh, it doesn't matter.
  - This place wasn't always so desolate. It was once teeming with life.
  - That was all before our king was seduced by the darkness and began his obsession
    to becoming a god.
  - He sacrified us by the hundreds, all in his search for ultimate power.
  - After he had what he wanted, he used the souls of those sacrificed to open a
    portal to hell itself and let loose it's armies.
  - He expected to lead the demons, but in a twist of fate, the demons slayed him.
  - A pity, but fate is a crule mistress.
  - Now here we find outselves; overun by these abominations and with no one to lead
    us. Hoping an praying for a savior.
  - But perhaps, we needn't pray much longer.
  - Take a look around camp and gather any supplies you might need.
  - If you expect to go back out into the world, you would do well to prepare yourself.
